    <p>Yet another web update...</p>
    <h3>2 Months later...</h3>
    <p>
      To err is human, to forgive is... ah whatever. Hello, I'm back. Thought I was dead huh? You could well consider that I was. But... I am not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, I've still been developing the site and doing art but I've been moving a snail's pace due to the way I do things. I have placed applications to various job openings that I could reasonably apply for, but no luck. It makes me wonder if software engineering is even a viable career for me. I've worked whenever I have time and I'm not disctracted by my friends and yet everything I do is not enoug. What do the companies want from me? A goddamn prodigy? Seriously now, I've learned and retained so much knowledge from whatever spare time I've spent studying software development concepts, principles, practices whatever and yet it is still not enough. I really need to make a huge portfolio or some shit huh? Easier said than done. I gotta learn things first before I can make things that are of a given standard. When the companies want to see me put out more shit its kinda putting the cart before the horse, I can't make stuff I know nothing about right? And don't give me that shit about using premade libraries and frameworks, if I know what they're based on there's no reason to learn them is there? aarggghhhh...
    </p>
    <h3>End rant</h3>
    <p>
      So anyway what have I learned in the past 2 months? Well, I've learned about dynamic web pages and how to make them. You need a webserver and some PHP, simple as. I more or less can use PHP no problem but when it comes to using extensions I might have some trouble as I don't know the intricacies of how to use them. Base level PHP though? Easy. Arrays, objects, functions whatever, I know how all that works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I've got the basics of SQL down, specifically MySQL. I do need to link up my PHP scripts with MySQL still but it shouldn't take too long. The next step in making my blog page creation process more dynamic and quick is to devise a form that can send data to PHP and PHP will create a blog page using the data and append data to the MySQL manager. From there PHP should also update the main blog page to show that a new blog post has been created. Then PHP should pull data from the database and blog page to fill out a html form (or page?) so instead of having tons of html docs I have one that's filled out on the fly so to speak. The blog content is stored in a text file while data necessary to retrieve said file is stored in the database. I think it should work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art site will have to wait a bit though. Even so, after I figure out this blog thing I think the art site should be real easy to make as its a blog in enough itself.
