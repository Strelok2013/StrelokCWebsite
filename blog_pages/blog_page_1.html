    <h3>First, some background...</h3>
    <p>
    Well anyway, hello and welcome to my dumb little blog post. I hope to update this as I go along with my projects. As you can see I've only recently managed to get openGL to work and compile on a linux machine.
    With that said, I took a detour to work on my website a bit, I doubt anyone would read this so its more of a diary than an actual blog anyone would read.
    So what's been happening? Why didn't this website have a blog when the promise of one was made? Well, I'll tell you: I fell into a slight bout of depression given that I haven't been able to get an IT or tech or programming (some variation of those) job. Funny ain't it? Guys that went through the same course as me and did the same thing as me got a job out of college but I didn't, really makes you wonder eh? Was it Covid? Was it the lack of a Website during my final weeks of College? Who knows, it doesn't really matter much as its all in the past now. So I wandered aimlessly for a time, not knowing what to do. I still had my hobby in art and thought that that might be a better option for money making than a proper stable job as a programmer (or IT guy), but that's a naive way to think. From what I've seen, you'd have to be an awesome pro with not only years
    of experience but also years of a portfolio (if that makes sense). And well, I don't really have a lot of time, especially now. I'm basically the only one whos taking care of the house and on top of that I have a part-time job that was meant to be a temprorary source of income so I could at least buy stuff I wanted or needed with my own money (bloody thing is my life now). That's not to say that I'm going to stay at my current job forever (I hope, the world is a cruel place). Hopefully with more work on this website and my silly little graphics projects some tech firm will take notice (though, I'm not optimistic about that).

    <h3>And now for some less depressing things...</h3>
    <p>So my projects, my work, my experience: I've had to switch to Linux after steam called for an end-of-service for windows 7. So I thought: "Well, I was going to switch at Linux at some point anyway." Doing so introduced a whole host of problems: A lotta things didn't work the same way as on windows and the things I brought over from windows didn't work either! The second hard drive with all my stuff wouldn't mount automatically and even the file system on it wasn't compatible with a lot of the stuff I was trying to run. The first thing I did on this machine make it have a functioning filesystem so I could run my steam games. Afterwards I tried getting a development environment set up: Text editor, debugger, compiler, etc. Kdevelop has been serving me well for the most part, I've managed to figure out how to get it to trigger breakpoints like in visual studio and also figured out how the GNU Make compiler works (or at least the C++ one). That and of course I had to get some openGL libraries and headers in as well to get myself back on my feet.<br> With everything said and done, I went and created the little graphics window seen at the beginning. Its not much given I could accomplish the same on my windows machine pretty easily and quickly but I did learn some new things. Particularly on how to do software development in a Linux environment. <br>
    After this blog post I hope to create a second one with more visual content and not just a wall of text. Hopefully it'll get the attention of some employers or even people who are working on their own indie projects.</p>

    <p>Til' next time, Strelok out. </p>
