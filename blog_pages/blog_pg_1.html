        <h3>Change is good...</h3>
        <p>
         So, what's happened? Well, I'll tell you: <br>
         I've gotten in to contact with an alumni from my college who started and finished the same course a year after me, and got some advice on how to improve my website and some things to change so that I have a better chance at landing a job. This means making the site look more professional and also to showcase my work on the front, rather than the back. Also making it more accessible by changing its layout when a mobile user accesses it.<br>
         <br>
         So, that's the reason as to why it looks a little different now, some things are missing and some new things have been added. With all that said, I want to go over the development of my site so far. The things I've done, issues I've ran into and considerations that I've made.
        </p>

        <h3>The things I've done...</h3>
        <p>
        If you've explored the site a bit you might've noticed that there's a 'Create button' on the blogs page. That's there for me personally and will not be available on the final release. I've been working on a way to make blog post making quicker and easier than writing in a text editor. This is what I have done so far:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/blog_images/page1/work_1.jpg">
        <p>
        Not much to look at but hopefully it'll be something I can use one day. Thus far the features that exist are:
        <ul>
        <li>PHP File upload</li>
        <li>Adding a line into the textarea</li>
        <li>Prepending and appending two asterisks (or stars -> *) on selected text in the textarea</li>
        <li>Adding a text area to the Form</li>
        <li>Adding a heading &lt;h1&gt; tag to the form</li>
        <li>Adding a paragraph &lt;p&gt; tag to the form</li>
        <li>Adding a file input tag to the form</li>
        </ul>
        There's not much else. Its not functional in the sense that I can make blog pages with it, but it can do stuff when you press buttons. I have a javascript file which handles all the current functionality. Now onto the next topic.
        </p>

         <h3>The issues I ran into...</h3>
         <p>
            The majority of issues I ran into were when I was writing the javascript file. At the start it was finding out how to get the html document and the javascript file to communicate with one another. I primarily used buttons which have onclick functions that point to functions in the javascript file. The other big issue I remember was testing whether or not code was being executed in the functions I wrote. I mostly solved this by peppering my functions with console.log() functions to see where the code was failing. This issue was also solved by clearing the cache and reloading the web page as sometimes it didn't update to reflect the changes in the javascript file. <br>
            <br>
            The last issue is just figuring out how to actually write a blog page writing page, if that makes sense. I've looked at some examples of what I want to do but I have a hard time deciding between them. So, moving on.
         </p>

         <h3>The considerations I've made...</h3>
         <p>
         Initially I intended to model my blog creation page after the one on Cubebrush, even though Cubebrush does not actually have blog per se. It instead uses a forum board style posting which has quite a bit of functionality similar to a blog (or atleast what I want to be able to do). However, it doesn't quite work as it puts all the posts/replies onto one page which dynamically loads the responses as you scroll. I'd rather have separate pages that users can click on and view instead of one page with a very long and drawn-out comment thread.
         </p>

         <p>
         The other option was to do something similar to what Google blogger does, and make a web-based rich text editor similar to Microsoft Word or Libreoffice Writer. The text editor is closer to what I want so I'll be going along with that, trying to implement enough features from that to make an editor suited to my needs.

         <h3>Before I go...</h3>
         <p>
         So after all that's said and done I think I'll go back to actually working on my C++ graphics project. With the faster blog page creation I'll be able to also track and showcase my progress on this site. There's also the art section of the site that I want to get done but I might have to put it on hold as I need to build up my portfolio to get a job faster. Of course getting a full-time developer position will make it even harder but I'll probably still work on it regardless. I already juggle a bunch of things without too much issue so a full-time job shouldn't be much of a problem.<br>
