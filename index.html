<h2>About me</h2>
	<!-- Include skills and strengths -->
	<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px; margin: 30px;">Just some guy who works with computers. But seriously I'm more or less a general programmer that has branched out from the world of C# and C++. <br>
	I like writing my own libraries and tools, going as far as to write my own UI rendering API in OpenGL. I also like having an intricate understanding of how something works. The more in-depth knowledge I have of how something works the better. This is why I love diving into technical manuals and reading documentation.<br>
	<br>
	I have the most experience working with graphics libraries and prefer to work on graphics-related systems. However, I also have a bit of experience writing gameplay code.
	<br>
	<br>
	Everything you see on this website is purely written by me. No APIs or frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript.
