<h2>About me</h2>
	<!-- Include skills and strengths -->
	<p>Just some guy who works with computers. But seriously I'm more or less a general programmer that has branched out from the world of C# and C++. I also know HTML, CSS and a bit of javascript. I'm currently in the process of learning how to use git or git BASH as well as SQL. I tend to be a bit pessimistic and cynical, a byproduct of my depression. Though, I'm not really depressed now, just bored. I don't have a lot of faith in software software development as a career. My countless attempts in getting a job have led to failure. Now I mostly view software dev as a hobby, like my art. I figure I'd have more luck getting a job as a janitor or something.</p>
	
	<h3>I have experience with the following:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>C++</li>
		<li>Unity Game Engine</li>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>FreeBSD</li>
		<li>CLI (Command Line Interface)</li>
		<li>OpenGL</li>
		<li>Krita (Digital painting app)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Interests and hobbies include:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Game Engine Development</li>
		<li>Digital Art</li>
		<li>Console Emulation</li>
		<li>Web development</li>
		<li>Old-style computer aesthetic</li>
	</ul>
