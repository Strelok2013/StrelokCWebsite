    <h3>1 Month later...</h3>
    <p>
    Ach, its been a month or so since I've updated the blog. To be honest I haven't made much progress with the minesweeper/game engine project I'm working on. Mostly I was just able to render a rectangle given an x, y, width and height. Otherwise, I've dipped my toes into SQL and database stuff. I also sent out some applications to junior positions and to my surprise, one company responded. I didn't really get too excited given my pessimism, nihilism and cynicism. They had a quick chat with me and such and moved me to the interview, which again surprised me (slightly), but you can imagine what I will say next. They closed the junior software engineer position right after my interview. Again, given my pessimism I wasn't surprised at this outcome but maybe there was an inkling of hope that I might be able to quit my shit part-time job. Ah well.

    <h3>Removing Doomer mindset...</h3>
    <p>
    Anyway, the announcement I wanted make is that I will be trying to add in an art site or something of the sort. It was always planned but this website was a small scale thing that I didn't really want to work on much unless I made significant progress. Which, I did by the way, so far I've progressed quite well (in my opnion) in my artistic skills, being able to create somewhat believable anthro-dragon characters. The presence of 'art pieces' (WIPs that I will either never finish or revisit sometime in the future) has facilitated the need for a platform to host them on. Now, I could always host them on deviantart, furaffinity and whatever other image/art hosting websites there are... but why? I don't wanna do that, I'm on those sites to browse not host (hypocritical, heh). I find it more interesting to develop my own personal little shitbox platform that's mine and mine alone, one which I know damn well what went into it, how it works and that my data ain't being held god-knows-where.

    With that being said, heres a little teaser as to the things I've drawn ;):

    First one was drawn a while back and was the first instance where I used color, all my drawings before were grayscale or just plain lineart. 2nd one was a sorta experiment but turned out very similar to the first. Last two were done very quickly within days of each other (very surprising, given I can barely organize time to draw.) 3rd one feels off in some ways but eh, I barely draw and again, I seriously surprised myself with what I can draw despite having little confidence in my ability. 4th one was done within like 15 minutes or so on a train. Interestingly the last one was drawn while I was on the way back from my tech job interview, probably why it turned out so great and was drawn so quickly, because I was hopeful. <br>
    Ah well, I suppose I'll have to suffer a little longer with my current job.
    </p>
    <p>
    Oh and one other thing of note is that I might try to automate the blog writing process in some way, like having a form to fill out and stuff along with images to be uploaded. Also maybe set up a database for all the images I'll be uploading to the "Art" section of this website.
